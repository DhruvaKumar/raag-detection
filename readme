The main code is in 'main.m' and its dependencies are located in 'src/*'

main.m has the following 3 sections:
To test, please run the last section!
	- data preprocessing: processes the data in the 'train' directory and creates 'models/model.mat'
	- training (baum welch) is done on 'models/data.mat' and 'models/model.mat' is generated.
	- testing on the files located in the 'test' directory with 'models/model.mat'

All the source files are documented well.

Directories:
- models - to store intermediate data/models
- plots - figures, plots generated
- report - report
- src - all the src files which main.m is dependent on.
- test - contains 16 test sequences
- train - contains 3 sequences for each of the 5 raag class.
