TODO: 

Sources of pitch:
	- praat
	- aubio

Raag classes:
	- Bihag
	- Desh
	- Gaud Malhar
	- Darbari
	- Yaman

- Training data {pittu (srd), sugato (str)}
- Testing data {nayan (str), manilal (str), falguni (v)}

Params to tweak:
- No pitch present? 
	- C
--	- continue the previous note
	- skip them completely
- Remove C completey? (Sympathetic strings)
- Sources of pitch?
- incorporate amplitude and quantize using k means? k? (if i have time?)
- Incorporate aaroh, avroh, pakad?	



models									programmed		simluating 	simulted
- basic										-				-72			- 36
- with previous note continued				-				-36
- remove 0s completely						-				-36

- incorporating aaroh, avroh, pakad
- incorporate amplitude

Key points:
- multi modal raag identification
- same thaat

results
- cv
- test set

future work: 
- extend the data set, especially training
- incorporate explicit aaroh, avroh, pakad and increase its weight
- use better pitch detection algorithms. try to remove the sympathetic string sound/drone sound so that HMM can learn the transition probabilites between the notes better than the transition to the tonic frequency pitch
- incorporate more feautres like amplitude and quantize kmeans

PPT

Raag detection

1. What is a raag?

2. Why do I care?

3. Characteristic elements of a raag

4. Algorithm:
	- Dataset: GTraagDB
	- Feature extraction and quantization(pitch detection)
	- 

5. Dataset: GTraagDB
	- http://prernagupta.com/parag/data/GTraagDB/
	- Consists of 31 raags assembled by Parag Chordia
	- Recordings include either vocals or instruments. 
	- Training set: 5 raag classes 
		- Bihag
		- Darbari
		- Desh
		- Gaud Malhar
		- Yaman
	- 3 samples each of sitar and sarod (indian classical instruments)
	- Test set: 16 samples consisting of sitar and vocal recordings.

6. Feature extraction and quantization
	- Pitch detection using Praat
	- Quantize pitch frequency to nearest 
	TODO: insert c.mp3
